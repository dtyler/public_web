Why I love linux (and most unix descendants)

* File System Structure
    - consistent place for certain types of file
    - extensible (mount points)
    - everything is a file
* Small tools with specific tasks
    - cat, grep, cut, find, vim
* Permissions wired into the file system
* Package management
    - Central tracking/management of 
        - files associated with programs
        - interdependency between version
